Q2.
Recursive String Length Calculator
In a digital document management system, each document is represented as a string. As part of the system's features, you need to determine the length of a string using a recursive approach. This feature is essential for efficient document analysis without relying on built-in methods.

Your task is to write a program that calculates the length of a given string using recursion.



Input Format

A single string SSS representing the content of the document.


Output Format

An integer representing the length of the string.


Example 1

Sample Input 1

hello



Sample Output 1 

5



Explanation

The string "hello" has 5 characters, so the output is 5.


Example 2

Sample Input 2 

recursion



Sample Output 2 

9



Explanation

The string "recursion" has 9 characters, so the output is 9.


CODE:
def get_length(s):
    if s == "":
        return 0
    return 1 + get_length(s[1:])

s = input()
print(get_length(s))

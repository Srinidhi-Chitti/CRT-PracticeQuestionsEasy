Q2.
Leena's Business Loan
Leena has always dreamed of starting her own business, and she finally put together a compelling business proposal. After discussing her idea with her friend, she was introduced to Meena, a successful owner of a construction company who was interested in supporting emerging entrepreneurs. Meena, impressed by Leena's proposal, agreed to invest in her business by providing a loan.

Meena offers Leena a loan of Rs. X for Y years at an interest rate of R% per annum. The deal is that Leena will have to repay the loan along with the interest accrued over the years. However, as an additional incentive, Meena promises a 2% discount on the total interest if Leena successfully repays the loan. Leena is thrilled about the opportunity but needs help calculating:

The total interest she'll owe.
The total amount she has to repay (principal + interest).
The discount on the interest, as per the offer.
The final amount after applying the discount.
Given the principal amount X, the rate of interest R%, and the loan period in years Y, write a program to:

Calculate the total interest payable by Leena.
Calculate the total amount (principal + interest).
Calculate the discount on the interest (2% of the interest).
Calculate the final amount Leena needs to repay after applying the discount.
All values must be formatted to two decimal places.



Input Format

The input consists of three floating-point values:

The first value corresponds to the principal amount borrowed by Leena (Rs. X).
The second value corresponds to the rate of interest (R%).
The third value corresponds to the loan period in years (Y).


Output Format

The output consists of four floating-point values, each formatted to two decimal places:

The interest.
The total amount (principal + interest).
The discount on the interest.
The final settlement amount after applying the discount.


Sample Input

100

1

10



Sample Output 

Interest: 10.00

Total Amount: 110.00

Discount: 0.20

Final Settlement Amount: 109.80





Explanation

Interest Calculation:

This formula calculates the total interest that Leena will owe over the entire loan period. For example, if Leena borrows Rs. 100 at a rate of 1% for 10 years, the interest will be calculated as:

Interest = (100 * 1 * 10) / 100 = 10.00

This means Leena will owe Rs. 10 in interest after 10 years.



Total Amount Calculation:

This calculates the total amount Leena will need to repay to Meena after 10 years. Continuing with our example:

Total Amount = 100 + 10 = 110.00

Therefore, the total amount Leena will repay after 10 years is Rs. 110.



Discount Calculation:

Since Meena offers a 2% discount on the total interest, we calculate how much this discount is. For our example:

Discount = 0.02 * 10 = 0.20

This indicates that Leena will receive a Rs. 0.20 discount on the interest.



Final Settlement Calculation:

The final settlement amount is the total amount to be paid after applying the discount. Using our figures:

Final Settlement = 110 - 0.20 = 109.80

Thus, the final amount Leena needs to repay after applying the discount is Rs. 109.80.


CODE:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    float principal, rateOfInterest, years;
  
    scanf("%f %f %f", &principal, &rateOfInterest, &years);
  
    float interest = (principal * rateOfInterest * years) / 100;
   
    float totalAmount = principal + interest;
 
    float discount = 0.02f * interest;

    float finalSettlement = totalAmount - discount;
  
    printf("Interest: %.2f\n", interest);
    printf("Total Amount: %.2f\n", totalAmount);
    printf("Discount: %.2f\n", discount);
    printf("Final Settlement Amount: %.2f\n", finalSettlement);

    return 0;
}

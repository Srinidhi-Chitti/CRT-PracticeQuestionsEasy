Q2.
Machine Settings Adjustment for Precision Manufacturing
In a precision manufacturing unit, a machineâ€™s settings need to be adjusted periodically based on a predefined series to ensure accuracy in production. The series used for these settings is defined as: 0, 0, 2, 1, 4, 2, 6, 3, 8, 4, 10, 5, 12, 6, 14, 7, 16, 8...

The series is a combination of two distinct sequences:

All the odd terms in the series form a sequence of even numbers in ascending order: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, ...
All the even terms are derived from the previous odd term using the formula: x/2x / 2x/2.
Your task is to write a program to determine the Nth term of the series, which will be used to set the machine configuration on the Nth adjustment cycle.



Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer N, representing the adjustment cycle number.


Output Format

Print the Nth term in the series.


Example 1

Sample Input 1

5



Sample Output 1

4



Explanation

The 5th term is an odd term in the series. The odd terms form a sequence of even numbers: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ... The 3rd term in this sequence is 4.


Example 2

Sample Input 2

8



Sample Output 2

3



Explanation

The 8th term is an even term in the series. It is derived from the previous odd term (6) using the formula 6/2=3.

CODE:
#include <stdio.h>

int findNthTerm(int N) 
{
    if (N % 2 == 1) 
    {
        return (N / 2) * 2;  // Odd positions: return even numbers
    } 
    else 
    {
        return (N / 2) - 1;  // Even positions: return odd numbers
    }
}

int main() 
{
    int N;
    scanf("%d", &N);
    printf("%d\n", findNthTerm(N));
    return 0;
}

Q2.
Forbidden forest
Harry was moving through the forbidden forest. A spirit crossed his path and told him that he has to answer her question correctly or she would kill him. She told him to give her a reversed string such that each word is in its original position and the words which remain same after reversing should be enclosed within $. Harry being a wizard, has no knowledge of Muggle technology and asks for your help.

Help Harry in finding out the required string.



Input Format 

Input1: input string



Output Format

Return the reversed string



Example 1

Sample Input 1

Input1: zebra bat ball



Sample Output 1

arbez tab llab



Explanation

In example 1, the word “zebra” when rotated gives “arbez” and so on.



Example 2

Sample Input 2

Input1: aba



Sample Output 2

$aba$



Explanation

In example 2, the word “aba” is a palindrome and hence gives “$aba$”.


CODE:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

bool isPalindrome(char *word) {
    int len = strlen(word);
    for (int i = 0; i < len / 2; i++) {
        if (word[i] != word[len - 1 - i])
            return false;
    }
    return true;
}

void reverseString(char *str) {
    int len = strlen(str);
    for (int i = 0; i < len / 2; i++) {
        char temp = str[i];
        str[i] = str[len - 1 - i];
        str[len - 1 - i] = temp;
    }
}

int main() {
    char input[1000];
    fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);

    input[strcspn(input, "\n")] = '\0';

    char *word = strtok(input, " ");
    while (word != NULL) {
        char temp[1000];
        strcpy(temp, word);

        reverseString(word);

        if (isPalindrome(temp)) {
            printf("$%s$ ", word);
        } else {
            printf("%s ", word);
        }

        word = strtok(NULL, " ");
    }

    return 0;
}
